GIT BRANCH
Lets think you have 3 commits in main branch
created a new branch from main so new branch also have 3 commits 
You can add new commits to new branch

git branch -b <branch_name>
git checkout <branch_name>
git checkout -b <branch_name>


GIT DELETE
If you merge your new branch to main branch then no problem
then your new commits in new branch will also present in main branch
If you dont merge your new branch then the commits in new branch will not be present

git branch -d <branch_name> for mergerd
git branch -D <branch_name> for not merged
git push --delete <remote> <branch_name>  delte on remote

GIT REVERT
To undo our changes and move back to a particulat commit
lets assume you have 3 commits

git resert --hard HEAD~1

this make you code move to second commit the commit will be present but wont appear

To revert a particulat commit changes you can use revert command
